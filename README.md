# string-in-c-pts3
This program prints two strings based on user's input, concatenates the two strings and prints it out to the user.
It also prints out the lenght of individual string, then sums both lenght together to give a third output that consists of the sum of both strings.
It also has a commented part that uses the 'strncat' to allow a user to concatenate the two strings but this time doesn't allow all strings of the second to be
printed rather it prints just 5 characters of the second string; while attached to the first.
